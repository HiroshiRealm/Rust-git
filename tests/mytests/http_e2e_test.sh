# It will:
# 1. Build the project.
# 2. Set up a temporary directory with a "server" and "client" repository.
# 3. Start the HTTP server in the background.
# 4. Run `pull` on the client and verify the result.
# 5. Run `push` from the client and verify the result on the server.
# 6. Clean up all temporary files and processes.

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
