# This script simulates a collaboration scenario with two clients and one server
# to test the non-fast-forward push rejection feature.
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Server starts with an initial commit.
# 2. Client 1 clones the repo.
# 3. Client 2 clones the repo.
# 4. Client 1 pushes a new commit successfully.
# 5. Client 2, now out of date, tries to push its own commit and fails.
# 6. Client 2 pulls the changes, merges them, and successfully pushes again.
